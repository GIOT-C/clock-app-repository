# Clock-App

Thank you for your interest in my project

**I needed to use html, css, javascript to write this project

#The project is written in TypeScript, a React component

The project uses various APIs to obtain the necessary data:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://ipapi.co/) to set the city and country
- [Programming Quotes API](https://api.quotable.io/quotes/random) to generate random programming quotes.

 The user can:
 - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
 -  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
 -  View the current time and location information based on their IP address
 -  View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
 -  They will see the correct greeting and background image based on when they visit the site
 -  Have the option to change random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote

   #Expected behavior of the program
   -Change the greeting based on the time of day:
    - "Good morning" between 5am and 12pm
    - "Good afternoon" between 12pm and 6pm
    - "Good evening" between 6pm and 5am
  -The greeting icon and background image will change depending on the time of day. They must show:
    - Sun icon and background image of the day from 5 AM to 6 PM
    - Moon icon and night background image from 6 am to 5 am
